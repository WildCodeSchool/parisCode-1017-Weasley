"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good."

# Here are the required actions you will have to implement to get a workable website

1. Composer is required: Install composer: https://getcomposer.org/download/
2. Clone project and run *composer install* to install all project depedencies
3. Create a folder public/uploads
4. Create app/config.php with your BDD informations


From any page of the public website (Home Page, Concept Page, Products Pagen Contact Page), you can access the admin section: 
--> go through the 'lock' icon in footer

Once in admin, please enter your login / password.

You are now in the admin section and you can:
